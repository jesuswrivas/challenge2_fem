## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

-Media queries. Hadn't had the chance to read about it. Tried to build the html and css taking in mind the issues it might cause to the mobile view. A lot of issues came up: overflowing, unexpected div sizing.

-Unlike the 1st challenge. I'm using now flexbox mostly for centering purposes and building the main layout of the page.



### Continued development

Media queries. Need best practices or pointers, specially at the time of laying out the html.

Flexbox. The way flexbox behaves when changing the screen size or changing to mobile view, is still feeling unknown to me. I'm aware of the flex shorthand as a property but sometimes its not behaving as expected.
